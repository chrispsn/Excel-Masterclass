*Another* Excel tutorial?

There are plenty of Excel tutorials on the internet, but most focus on how to use specific features. They don't focus on how to use features **well**.

This tutorial instead focuses on **spreadsheet design choices**. We'll discuss questions such as:

* How should I structure my data?
* How should I write this formula?
* How should I present this data to users?

It assumes you already know how to use Excel reasonably well - and can create working solutions to your problems. This tutorial shows you how to make your solutions *better*:

* Reduce confusion for end users
* Save time in maintenance
* Reduce the likelihood of errors.

We will look at concrete examples along the way.

The advice is based on experience of the author, `Chris Pearson`__.
