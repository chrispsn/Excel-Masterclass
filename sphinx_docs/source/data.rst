Structure data so it can be easily consumed by Excel's functions - one column per dimension of data.

.. XXX currently describe records in calculation article - should this be done here?

Store records in Excel Tables:

* Data structure naturally falls out
* Structured references (more readable formulas; calculations don't need to know location/length of data)
* Calculated columns (easy application of a formula to all records)
* Easy use with VBA (eg 'clear records' button)
